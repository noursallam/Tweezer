## Usage

### File Scanning

Scan a local file:
```bash
tweezer [filename] -k [options]
```

### URL Scanning

Scan a website or web page:
```bash
tweezer -y https://example.com -k [options]
```

### Global Access

The setup script sets up an alias for `tweezer`, enabling global usage.

### Command Line Options
```bash
usage: twz.py [-h] [-y URL] [-k KEYS [KEYS ...]] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] [filename]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  filename              Path to the file to search
  -y, --url URL        URL to extract sensitive information from
  -k, --keys KEYS      Specific keys to extract (e.g., e ph cc ip)
  -o, --output OUTPUT  Output directory for results (default: current directory)
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose logging
```

---

### Examples

Scan a local file for all patterns:
```bash
tweezer sensitive_data.txt
```

Scan a website for specific patterns:
```bash
tweezer -y https://example.com -k e ph ip
```

Scan a file for credentials with verbose logging:
```bash
tweezer config.txt -k pw ak ssh jwt -v
```

Scan a URL and save results to a specific directory:
```bash
tweezer -y https://example.com -o /path/to/results
```

## üìñ Pattern Reference

Tweezer uses sophisticated regular expressions to detect various types of sensitive information:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URL Scanning Notes

- The URL scanner respects `robots.txt` and implements rate limiting.
- Only publicly accessible pages can be scanned.
- Network timeouts are handled gracefully.
- URLs must include the protocol (`http://` or `https://`).
- Redirects are followed automatically (up to a maximum of 5 redirects).
- JavaScript-rendered content cannot be scanned.
- Some websites may block automated scanning.
